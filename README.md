I am an ISTQB (CTFL) certified Software Engineer / SDET with ~3 years of experience in test automation, backend development, and quality engineering for enterprise-grade banking systems. At Nucleus Software, I design and maintain scalable automation frameworks using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber (BDD), integrated with Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD. My contributions have reduced manual testing effort by over 40% and significantly improved regression coverage.

Along with test automation, I have engineered backend components using Java, Spring MVC, and Struts 2.x, leveraging SQL/PLSQL for efficient data handling, logic validation, and permanent bug fixes aligned with SDLC best practices. I also bring hands-on expertise in REST API testing (Postman, RestAssured) and domain knowledge of lending platforms like FinnOne Neo (LMS, CAS, Masters), ensuring reliable end-to-end system performance.

Passionate about automation, backend logic, and process optimization, I thrive in Agile/Scrum environments, collaborating across teams, mentoring peers, and delivering high-quality solutions.
